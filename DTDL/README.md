## Introduction
This document specifies the Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL), a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT digital twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical environment such as shipping containers, rooms, factory floors, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Broadly, modeling enables IoT solutions to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using DTDL to describe a digital twin's capabilities enables the IoT platform and IoT solutions to leverage the semantics of the entity.

## Digital Twin Definition Language
Digital twins are described using a variant of JSON called JSON-LD. JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON as well as usable in Resource Description Framework (RDF) systems. RDF is a widely adopted standard for describing resources in a distributed, extensible way. We chose JSON-LD because it is JSON and because it is an easy-to-use language for RDF. Developers can use DTDL with no knowledge of RDF, but, equally important, can take advantage of semantic annotations and RDF using the same entity definitions.

DTDL is made up of a set of metamodel classes (described in the rest of this document) that define the capabilities of digital twins. There are two top-level classes, `CapabilityModel` and `Interface`, that describe digital twins and the capabilities of digital twins, respectively. There are three metamodel classes that describe capabilities: `Telemetry`, `Property`, and `Command`. In addition, because data is a key element in IoT solutions, DTDL provides a data description language that is compatible with many popular serialization formats, including JSON and binary serialization formats. When a digital twin uses DTDL, it describes its capabilities using these metamodel classes (`Interfaces`, `Telemetry`, `Properties`, `Commands`, and data types) and often implements those capabilities using an SDK in terms of these metamodel classes.

Lastly, DTDL provides semantic type annotations of capabilities, so that analytics, machine learning, UIs, and other computation can reason about the semantics of the data, not just the schema of the data. For example, properties that are semantically annotated as "temperature" can be reasoned about as temperature (charted together, compared, converted to like units, etc.) instead of simply double data types.

When writing a digital twin definition, it's necessary to specify the version of DTDL being used. Because DTDL is based on JSON-LD, we use the JSON-LD context (the `@context` statement) to specify the version of DTDL being used.

## CapabilityModel
A `CapabilityModel` describes a device and defines the set of interfaces implemented by the device.

A capability model includes the identifiers of the interfaces that it implements (including the version number). A new version of the capability model must be created when the device implements a new version of an interface, or when the device implements a new interface.

Capability models must follow these rules for the interfaces they implement.
* A capability model can only implement one instance of each interface.
* A capability model can only implement one version of each interface. A capability model cannot implement two versions of the same interface.
* A newer version of a capability model must include all the interfaces implemented by the previous version (although the version numbers of the interfaces can be the same or greater than the interface versions in the previous capability model version).

### CapabilityModel properties

### CapabilityModel examples
This `CapabilityModel` example shows a thermostat that implements two `Interface`s.
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example.com:thermostat_T_1000:1",
    "@type": "CapabilityModel",
    "displayName": "Thermostat T-1000",
    "implements": [
        {
            "name": "thermostat",
            "schema": "urn:example:thermostat:1"
        },
        {
            "name": "urn_azureiot_DeviceManagement_DeviceInformation",
            "schema": "urn:azureiot:DeviceManagement:DeviceInformation:1"
        }
    ],
    "@context": "http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/CapabilityModel.json"
}
```
This example shows defining an `Interface` inline with a `CapabilityModel`.
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example:thermostat_T_1000:1",
    "@type": "CapabilityModel",
    "displayName": "Thermostat T-1000",
    "implements": [
        {

        }
    ],
    "@context": "http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/CapabilityModel.json"
}
```

### Field
A `Field` describes a field in an object.

#### Field properties
| Property | Required | Data type | Limits | Version rules | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | required | string | 1-64 chars | immutable | The "programming" name of the field. The name must match this regular expression `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`. The name must be unique for all fields in this object.|
| schema | required | `Schema` | | immutable | The data type of the field. |
| @id | optional | [DT id](#digital-twin-identifier-format) | max 256 chars | version number can be incremented | The ID of the field description. If no @id is provided, the digital twin interface processor assigns one. |
| comment | optional | string | 1-512 chars | mutable | A developer comment. |
| description | optional | string | 1-512 chars | mutable | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) description for human display. |
| displayName | optional | string | 1-64 chars | mutable | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) name for human display. |
| displayUnit | optional | string | 1-64 chars | mutable | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) unit name for human display. |
| unit | optional | `Unit` | | mutable | The unit type of the field. |

## Interface schemas
Within an interface definition, complex schemas may be defined for reusability across telemetry, properties, and commands. This is designed to promote readability and improved maintenance because schemas that are reused can be defined once (per interface). Interface schemas are defined in the schemas property of an interface. When an interface is defined within a capability model, any schemas defined in that interface may only be used in that interface, not across interfaces within the same capability model.

### Interface schema properties
| Property | Required | Data type | Limits | Version rules | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| @id | required | [DT id](#digital-twin-identifier-format) | max 256 chars | version number can be incremented | The globally unique identifier for the schema. |
| @type | required | `Array`, `Enum`, `Map`, or `Object` | | immutable | The type of complex schema. This must refer to one of the complex schema metamodel classes (`Array`, `Enum`, `Map`, or `Object`). |
| comment | optional | string | 1-512 chars | mutable | A developer comment. |
| description | optional | string | 1-512 chars | mutable | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) description for human display. |
| displayName | optional | string | 1-64 chars | mutable | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) name for human display. |

                }

## Model versioning
In DTDL, capability models and interfaces are versioned by a single version number (positive integer) in the last segment of their identifiers. Once a version of a capability model or interface is finalized (published, used in production, etc.), its definition is immutable.

DTDL provides two ways to create new versions of capabilities models and interfaces.
1. Entirely new capability models and interfaces can be created to describe major changes, including breaking changes, such as removing a capability (telemetry, property, or command). Each major version has new identifier and starts its version number at 1.
2. New versions of capability models and interfaces can be created to describe minor changes, such as adding a new capability (telemetry, property, or command) or fixing a bug in a display name or description. Each minor version increments the version number of the capability model or interface.

In general, minor changes include adding new capabilities (telemetry, properties, and commands) or changing metadata, such as display names or descriptions. Changing capability names or schemas or removing capabilities is not allowed from version to version. The specific rules for versioning are described with each model element in this document.

### Model Versioning Examples
This example shows the kinds of changes that are allowed in new versions of an interface. In this example,
* The interface’s @id is updated to reflect the new version.
* The interface’s description is updated.
* The temp telemetry’s displayName and displayUnit are updated.
* A new humidity telemetry is added.
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example:thermostat:1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": "Thermostat",
    "description": "Thermostat that measures temperature.",
    "contents": [
        {
            "@type": "Telemetry",
            "name": "temp",
            "displayName": "Measured temp",
            "schema": "double",
            "displayUnit": "F"
        }
    ],
    "@context": "http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/Interface.json"
}
```
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example:thermostat:2",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": "Thermostat",
    "description": "Thermostat that measures temperature and humidity.",
    "contents": [
        {
            "@type": "Telemetry",
            "name": "temp",
            "displayName": "Measured temperature",
            "schema": "double",
            "displayUnit": "Fahrenheit"
        },
        {
            "@type": "Telemetry",
            "name": "humidity",
            "schema": "integer"
        }
    ],
    "@context": "http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/Interface.json"
}
```

## Additional concerns

### Digital Twin identifier format
Identities for all digital twin model elements must follow the digital twin identifier format. The digital twin model element identifier format is a simple URN, summarized here.
* Identifiers must start with the string "urn:".
* Each segment may only contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and underscore, conforming to this regular expression `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`.
* The only separator allowed is the colon character ':'.
* Identifiers are case sensitive.
* A valid identifier has at least four segments.
  1. The "urn" segment.
  2. A namespace segment. This segment may be made up of one or more segments.
  3. The name segment (second-to-last segment).
  4. The version segment (last segment).

Examples of digital twin model element identifiers.
```
urn:example:Thermostat:1
urn:iot:area51:dept42:Thruster:345
urn:contoso:AHU:dischargeAirTempSensor:6
```

### Display string localization
Some string properties in digital twins are meant for human display and, therefore, support localization. Localizable string in digital twin use JSON-LD's string internationalization support. Each localizable property (i.e. `displayName`, `displayUnit`, and `description`) is defined to be a JSON-LD language map (`"@container": "@language"`). The default language for digital twin documents is English. Localized string values are declared using their language code (as defined in [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)). Because of the composable nature of JSON-LD graphs, localized strings can be prepared in a separate file and merged with an existing graph.

#### Localization examples
In this example, no language code is used for the `displayName` property, so the default language English is used.
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example:thermostat:1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": "Thermostat"
}
```
In this example, the `displayName` property is localized into multiple languages.
```json
{
    "@id": "urn:example:thermostat:1",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": {
        "en": "Thermostat",
        "it": "Termostato"
    }
}
```

### Context
When writing a digital twin definition, it’s necessary to specify the version of DTDL being used. Because DTDL is based on JSON-LD, we use the JSON-LD context (the `@context` statement) to specify the version of DTDL being used.

For this version of DTDL, the capability model context is exactly `http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/CapabilityModel.json`.

For this version of DTDL, the interface context is exactly `http://azureiot.com/v1/contexts/Interface.json`.
