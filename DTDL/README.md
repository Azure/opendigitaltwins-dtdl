## Introduction
This document specifies the Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL), a language for describing models and interfaces for IoT digital twins. Digital twins are models of entities in the physical environment such as shipping containers, rooms, factory floors, and other entities that participate in IoT solutions. Broadly, modeling enables IoT solutions to provision, use, and configure IoT devices and logical entities from multiple sources in a single solution. Using DTDL to describe a digital twin's capabilities enables the IoT platform and IoT solutions to leverage the semantics of the entity.

## Digital Twin Definition Language
Digital twins are described using a variant of JSON called JSON-LD. JSON-LD is designed to be usable directly as JSON as well as usable in Resource Description Framework (RDF) systems. RDF is a widely adopted standard for describing resources in a distributed, extensible way. We choose JSON-LD because it is JSON and because it is an easy-to-use language for RDF. Developers can use DTDL with no knowledge of RDF, but, equally important, can take advantage of semantic annotations and RDF using the same entity definitions.

DTDL is made up of a set of metamodel classes (described in the rest of this document) that define the capabilities of digital twins. There are two top-level classes, `CapabilityModel` and `Interface`, that describe digital twins and the capabilities of digital twins, respectively. There are three metamodel classes that describe capabilities: `Telemetry`, `Property`, and `Command`. In addition, because data is a key element in IoT solutions, DTDL provides a data description language that is compatible with many popular serialization formats, including JSON and binary serialization formats. When a digital twin uses DTDL, it describes its capabilities using these metamodel classes (`Interfaces`, `Telemetry`, `Properties`, `Commands`, and data types) and often implements those capabilities using an SDK in terms of these metamodel classes.

Lastly, DTDL provides semantic type annotations of capabilities, so that analytics, machine learning, UIs, and other computation can reason about the semantics of the data, not just the schema of the data. For example, properties that are semantically annotated as "temperature" can be reasoned about as temperature (charted together, compared, converted to like units, etc.) instead of simply double data types.

When writing a digital twin definition, it's necessary to specify the version of DTDL being used. Because DTDL is based on JSON-LD, we use the JSON-LD context (the `@context` statement) to specify the version of DTDL being used.

## CapabilityModels and Interfaces
There are two top-level metamodel classes: `CapabilityModel` and `Interface`. Capability models describe a complete digital twin, such as a physical device or a space (such as a room). Often, capability models are associated with a product SKU, such as a "Tracker Tron 1000" asset tracker, while interfaces describe the related capabilities of an digital twin (its telemetry, properties, and commands). Interfaces are reusable and can be reused across different capability models. Capability models are often made up of multiple interfaces.

## CapabilityModel
A `CapabilityModel` describes a complete digital twin, such as a physical device or a space (such as a room) and defines the set of interfaces implemented by the digital twin. A capability model is an object with the type `CapabilityModel` (`"@type": "CapabilityModel"`).

Because a capability model definition includes the fully qualified identity of the interfaces that it implements (including the full three-part version number), when an interface is changed and is assigned a new version number (and therefore a new ID), the capability model does not automatically implement the changed interface. If it is intended that the capability model implement the changed interface, then the capability model must also be updated.

### CapabilityModel properties
| Property | Required | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| @id | required | [DT id](#digital-twin-identity-format) | An identifier for the capability model that follows the digital twin identity format. Two capability models with same identifier refer to the same capability model. |
| @type | required | IRI | The type of capability model instance. This must refer to the `CapabilityModel` metamodel class. |
| @context | required | IRI | The context to use when processing this capability model. For this version, it must be set to `http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/CapabilityModel.json` |
| implements | required | set of `Interface`s | A set of interfaces or interface ids. The set of interfaces listed is a minimum--the digital twin may implement additional interfaces not listed in the capability model. |
| comment | optional | string | A developer comment. |
| description | optional | string | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) description for human display. |
| displayName | optional | string | A [localizable](#display-string-localization) name for human display. |

### CapabilityModel examples
This `CapabilityModel` example shows a thermostat that implements two `Interface`s.
```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/thermostatDevice/1.0.0",
    "@type": "CapabilityModel",
    "displayName": "Thermostat T-1000",
    "implements": [
        "http://example.com/thermostat/1.0.0",
        "http://azureiot.com/interfaces/deviceInformation/1.1.3"
    ],
    "@context": "http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/CapabilityModel.json"
}
```
This example shows defining an `Interface` inline with a `CapabilityModel`.
```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/thermostatDevice/1.0.0",
    "@type": "CapabilityModel",
    "displayName": "Thermostat T-1000",
    "implements": [

    ],
    "@context": [
        "http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/CapabilityModel.json",
        "http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/Interface.json"
    ]
}
```

            "schema": "http://example.com/acceleration"
        }
    ],
    "schemas": [
        {
            "@id": "http://example.com/acceleration",
            "@type": "Object",
            "fields": [
                {
                    "name": "x",
                    "schema": "double"
                },
                {
                    "name": "y",
                    "schema": "double"
                },

            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Additional concerns

### Digital Twin identity format
Identities for CapabilityModels and Interfaces must follow the digital twin identity format. The digital twin identity format is a three-part Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) made up of an IRI prefix, name, and semantic version number: `<IRI-prefix>/<name>/<version>`.
* The IRI prefix is any valid IRI scheme, authority, and path (no query or fragment components allowed).
* The name must match this regular expression `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`.
* The version must be a three-part semantic version number (major, minor, and patch only) that follows the semver.org versioning rules.
* The IRI does not need to resolve to an actual resource.

#### Digital Twin identity equality
Digital twin identities follow [the RDF spec for IRI equality](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-IRIs). RDF IRI equality is defined as: two IRIs are equal if and only if they are equivalent under Simple String Comparison according to [section 5.3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-5.3.1) of RFC3987. We make a variation on the Simple String Comparison to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

When comparing digital twin identities for equality, the case-insensitive Simple String Comparison algorithm must be used (a case-insensitive character-by-character comparison like stricmp). This means the following digital twin identities are considered to be different identities.
```
http://example.com/myInterface/1.2.3
http://example.com/./myInterface/1.2.3
http://example.com:80/myInterface/1.2.3
```
The following digital twin identities are considered to be the same identities.
```
http://example.com/myInterface/1.2.3
HTTP://example.com/myInterface/1.2.3
http://example.com/MYINTERFACE/1.2.3
```

### Display string localization
Some string properties in digital twins are meant for human display and, therefore, support localization. Localizable string in digital twin use JSON-LD's string internationalization support. Each localizable property (i.e. `displayName`, `displayUnit`, and `description`) is defined to be a JSON-LD language map (`"@container": "@language"`). The default language for digital twin documents is English. Localized string values are declared using their language code (as defined in [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)). Because of the composable nature of JSON-LD graphs, localized strings can be prepared in a separate file and merged with an existing graph.

#### Localization examples
In this example, no language code is used for the `displayName` property, so the default language English is used.
```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/thermostat/1.0.0",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": "Thermostat"
}
```
In this example, the `displayName` property is localized into multiple languages.
```json
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/thermostat/1.0.0",
    "@type": "Interface",
    "displayName": {
        "en": "Thermostat",
        "it": "Termostato"
    }
}
```

### Context
When writing a digital twin definition, it’s necessary to specify the version of DTDL being used. Because DTDL is based on JSON-LD, we use the JSON-LD context (the `@context` statement) to specify the version of DTDL being used.

For this version of DTDL, the capability model context is exactly `http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/CapabilityModel.json`.

For this version of DTDL, the interface context is exactly `http://azureiot.com/v0/contexts/Interface.json`.
